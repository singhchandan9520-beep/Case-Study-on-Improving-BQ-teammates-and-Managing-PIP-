# 🌟 Case Study: Managing Business Quality (BQ) and PIP Agents to Improve CSAT

## 🏆 Objective  

Improve **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)** scores by addressing low-quality interactions and coaching agents under **PIP (Performance Improvement Plan)** to achieve sustainable performance growth.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement  

The CSAT scores were dropping below the target threshold, impacting overall business KPIs:  
- Negative customer feedback on communication & resolution quality  
- A higher-than-normal percentage of low BQ (Business Quality) audits  
- 3 agents under **PIP** due to consistently low CSAT and QA scores  

---

## 🧠 Root Cause Analysis  

I implemented a structured **4D Coaching Model (Define → Discover → Develop → Deliver)** approach:  

| Step | Key Actions |
|------|-------------|
| **Define** | Identified agents with CSAT below target and BQ errors > 10%; reviewed QA audit reports and customer verbatim |
| **Discover** | Conducted one-on-one meetings with PIP agents; analyzed call recordings, ticket handling style, tone, and resolution accuracy |
| **Develop** | Created a targeted action plan: call scripting practice, empathy & tone training, knowledge refreshers, and job aids |
| **Deliver** | Monitored performance weekly via BQ dashboard, provided feedback after every coaching session, recognized improvements |
